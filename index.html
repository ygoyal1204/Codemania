            <h3>
                Artificial intelligence is impacting the future of virtually every industry and every human being.
                Artificial intelligence has acted as the main driver of emerging technologies like big data, robotics and IoT, 
                and it will continue to act as a technological innovator for the foreseeable future.
                <br><br>
                AI is the biggest business opportunity of the next decade. It's already automating manual and repetitive tasks. 
                Soon it will augment human decisions. 
                <br><br>
                In the AI-enabled future, humans will be able to converse and interact with each other in the native language of choice,
                not having to worry about miscommunicating intentions.
                Machine learning models will be able to understand context,
                 nuance, and colloquialisms that help to fill the gaps of human communication.

                        <li>Artificial intelligence – having begun to merge with human intelligence in the previous century – now surpasses it, reaching whole new levels of cognitive and intellectual capability.</li>
                        <li>Almost every high-level decision by government and business now comes directly from these sentient machines, which oversee vast swathes of virtual employees, robots and other automated systems.</li>
                        <li>Companies like Google and Apple are already working on the AI prototypes which are right now far away from their finished states. But the 22nd century will surely be a time defined by robots that could think and do of their own.</li>

                        <li>Regular crewed trips to the gas giants; huge mining operations in the asteroid fields; and various interstellar probes.</li>
                        <li>Space tourism will surely boom during this period and trips to the Moon's surface and elsewhere will become relatively commonplace.</li>

                    <li>AI could automatically prepare the most important risks and actions given the patient’s clinical record. It could also automatically convert recorded dialogue of the consultation into a summary letter for the clinician to approve or amend.</li>
